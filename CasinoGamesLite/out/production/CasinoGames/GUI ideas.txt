The main page should contain somewhat styled buttons to pick what game to play.
    Either this, or a vertical nav bar on the side.
Upon choice, it shall trigger the existing code within CasinoApp.java for that game.
As for display itself, could have it as graphics (or anims) in its own section of the window.
    Key idea is to make it not be text-based and to rely more on visuals.
